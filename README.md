# Plant_Disease_Detection
 This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect plant diseases from images. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on a dataset of plant images to classify and identify various plant diseases. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
